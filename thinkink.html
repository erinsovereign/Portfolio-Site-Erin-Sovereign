                            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                            <p>
                                It may or may not come as a shock to you, but 38% of the world’s adult population has at least one tattoo. In the United States, that number jumps to a whopping 46% of adults who have one or more tattoos.
                                Considering how many people have tattoos, it’s odd there aren’t any mobile apps used to find inspiration for a tattoo or the perfect artist to create it. Currently, most people use other social media apps to
                                find tattoo photos and artists; usually Instagram or Pinterest. But there doesn’t seem to be one place where the tattoo community can be together online and share their art.<br />
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <h3>The challenge here is to provide this community with an app where they can find new tattoos, artists, and interact with others like themselves.</h3>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                            <p>
                                Most users find their tattoo ideas on Pinterest or Instagram, but neither of these apps have the tattooing community as their focus. Looking at products just for tattoos, I found Tattoodo and TrueArtists.
                                Tattoodo has both a website and a mobile application but doesn’t have the most extensive database of artists. TrueArtists is much more focused on the artists than the tattoos, but doesn’t have a very wide
                                reach geographically. Also, TrueArtists does not have a mobile application.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <h3>There isn’t a product where users can go through the whole tattoo process in one place, which often slows down the process of getting a new tattoo.</h3>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
                            <p>ThinkInk aims to provide the tattoo community with a one-stop-shop to find inspiration for their next tattoo, work with the perfect artist to bring their vision to life, and connect with others.</p>
                            <br />
                            <h2>"How?"</h2>
                            <p>
                                ThinkInk will have an extensive database of tattoos from other users, along with the studio and artist that created them. Users can post photos, articles they want to share, or even just share an experience
                                with the community. There’s also a database of artists with their work posted and reviews from their customers. When a photo is added to the tattoo database, the user will input as much information as
                                possible to allow the algorithm to apply the right tags to the photo. This makes the detailed filtering system as accurate as possible to give users the exact tattoos they want to see.

                            <p>
                                To get a better understanding of user needs, I conducted several user interviews as well as an online survey to gather data and group the data into affinity maps. The survey got data from a variety of
                                potential users, which helped me design the questions and goals for the user interviews. Then the user interviews went in-depth to get important information about user needs. The affinity maps will help me
                                organize my data, identify common threads, and focus on specific features needed.

                                Using the data and insights from the survey and interviews, I created three distinct user personas. These will help guide the design early on to make sure it stays in line with the users’ needs. The personas
                                give a realistic view of who the app is being designed for and what needs they have.

                                    I originally created a sitemap, thinking I would design both a website and a mobile application. However, as I got further in the design process, I decided to focus on the mobile application. So this
                                    sitemap was used as a framework for the mobile app, simplified, but without losing the core features and functions.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    To get the ball rolling, I started by sketching some basic ideas for the home screen, tattoos tab, filters window, and artists’ profile. Then I took these sketches and turned them into wireframes in Adobe
                                    XD. I tried to keep things simple to concentrate mainly on getting the ideas on paper.<br />

                                    The three tasks I focused on were:

                                    <li>Finding reviews for an artist on their profile</li>

                                    After completing an overhaul of the application, I gathered the colors, typography, UI Components, layout, imagery & illustrations, and language guidelines to build a Design System Language. This serves
                                    to help different teams and designers on a project come in and know what standards and guidelines need to be followed. This allows a team to have a cohesive design.
